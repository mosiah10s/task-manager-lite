Front-End Developer Technical Assessment
Skills Evaluated:
• JavaScript fundamentals (DOM manipulation, logic, async)
• HTML structure and semantics
• Light CSS styling
• Use of a front-end framework (React, Angular, Svelte, etc.)
• Code readability and structure
• Logical thinking and creativity (logical creativity)

Task: Build a Mini App – "Task Manager Lite"
Create a simple task management app with the following features:
Functional Requirements
1. Add a Task
• Each task should include:
• A title (required)
• An optional description
• A priority (or priority rank)
• An estimated duration (in minutes)
• A due date (date)

2. Mark as Complete
• Completed tasks should be visibly distinct (e.g., strike-through or faded out).
3. Delete a Task
• A user should be able to remove a task.
4. Automated Sorting
• Set up an automated sorting framework to prioritize work (this could be based on
priority, time estimates, due dates, etc.)
5. Persist Data in LocalStorage
• Tasks should persist between page reloads.
6. Use of a Front-End Framework
• Use React, Angular, Svelte, etc. (any other of your choice is acceptable).

Optional Bonus
• Allow editing of existing tasks.
• Add filters (All / Completed / Incomplete).

• Minimal but clean CSS (layout and UX focus over design polish).
Submission Guidelines
• Share via GitHub (or another git repo) or ZIP.
• Be prepared to talk through your process and thoughts especially on:
• Framework used
• Logical approach to automated sorting
• Any assumptions or enhancements

What We’re Looking For
• Clear, maintainable code
• Logical implementation
• Good use of framework features (components, state, etc.)
• Handling of edge cases
• Basic UX awareness
